First, let me tell you how I beat Covid 8 times so far!
In 1987, my ankle was injured in a motorcycle
accident and I couldn't walk for three
months! When I could walk again, I 
decided to test my strength on the weights
again! I tried a moderately heavy weight
for clean & jerking. Succeeding, I next loaded
up with my heaviest successful C & J and easily
succeeded again! This is without any weight
lifting for 3 months, doing only situps
and leg raises! I concluded that these
two exercises, fully utilised my food
and RECHARGED my body!
When I first got the Covid 'virus'- runny nose,
a pain in my left lung for the first time
in 84+ years, breathlessness, coughing and
sneezing simultaneously, I didn't know
what to do! So, I tried the leg raise
exercise, but standing, pulling my knees
up to my chest alternately, virus and 
pollution, as well, for about 20 times 
each leg,  with no mask, washing
of hands or any social distancing and 
succeeded! EIGHT times! I wear NO mask,
unless demanded by frightened store
employees or taxi drivers! My dog, an Australian
Shepherd, has it but. I still allow her to kiss me
lie on my chest face-to-face with no fear!
I believe Covid was released to make the
frightened people beg or demand a vaccine
with ulterior purposes! Go read the message
on the Georgia Guidestones!
